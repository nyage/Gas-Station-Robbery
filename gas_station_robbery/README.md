---Config---
There is no config file I ran into problems dofile and didnt feel like converting to json so reverted to my orginal code.
All configs are found at the top of client.lua 
It is very simple and 100% works 
Feel Free to add on to this script its very basic and is my first public free release as I was testing this before I make a advanced version
